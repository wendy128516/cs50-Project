# Project - Journey Plan 

## Introduction
This is my final project for CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science.

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Before traveling, planning the schedule is important for each person to use time effectively.
Journey Plan is a responsive website that is good for any device size.
This website is easy and clear to use, providing four main functions: creating, editing, deleting, and displaying the journey plan and daily schedule.

## Technologies Used
The website was created using Flask in Python.
SQLite and SQLAlchemy are useful for setting up the database and querying it.
Jinja passes the database's information to HTML.
Some great interactive functions are built using JavaScript.
CSS and Bootstrap are simple for designing a responsive and well-designed website.
